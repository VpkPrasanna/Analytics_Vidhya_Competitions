Problem Statement
Topic Modeling for Research Articles

Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.

Given the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. 

Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: 

1. Computer Science

2. Physics

3. Mathematics

4. Statistics

5. Quantitative Biology
